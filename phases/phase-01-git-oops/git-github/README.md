# Git & GitHub

## 🔹 Repository Setup

- `git init` : Initialize a new repository
- `git clone` : Download an existing repository

## 🔹 Tracking & Staging

- `git status` : Check changes
- `git add [filename | .]` : Move files to staging area
- `git commit -m "message"` : Save changes

## 🔹 History & Differences

- `git log` : View commit history
- `git diff` : See changes between commits/branches
  - Example: `git diff main master`
  - Example: `git diff commit1 commit2`

## 🔹 Branching & Switching

- `git branch` : List all branches
- `git branch [branchname]` : Create new branch
- `git checkout -b [branchname]` : Create and switch to new branch
- `git checkout [branchname]` : Switch branch

## 🔹 Combining Work

- `git merge [branchname]` : Combine branch
- `git rebase` : Move my commits for clean history

## 🔹 Get & Upload

- `git pull` : Get latest changes
- `git push origin main` : Upload changes

## 🔹 Resetting Commits

- `git reset` : Move branch [HEAD] pointer backward, optionally change files (Rolling back commits in Git )
  - **Soft reset** : Remove commit, files stay staged
  - **Mixed reset** : Remove commit, files unstaged in working directory
  - **Hard reset** : Remove commit, remove all files from directory

## 🔹 Revert Commits
- `git revert <commithash>` : Rolling back commits in Git (safe method) (for the production we used)

## For the Merge Conflict Resolve

---
```
PS D:\fullStackInternTraining-Pratik> git push origin main

! [rejected] main -> main (non-fast-forward)
error: failed to push some refs to 'https://github.com/pratikjetani0/fullStackInternTraining.git'
