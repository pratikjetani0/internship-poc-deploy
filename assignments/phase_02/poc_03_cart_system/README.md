# Mini Shop - Product Listing & Cart System

## Project Overview

Mini Shop is a responsive frontend e-commerce cart application built using **HTML, CSS, and JavaScript**.

The application dynamically displays products from a JavaScript array and allows users to manage a shopping cart in real time.

Users can:

- Browse products
- Add items to cart
- Add new products using form
- Increase / decrease quantity
- Remove items
- View total price updates instantly
- Receive toast notifications
- Keep cart data saved after page refresh using localStorage

This project demonstrates practical understanding of:

- DOM manipulation
- JavaScript array methods
- Event handling
- Browser storage
- Form handling

## 🚀 Features

## Product Listing

Products are dynamically rendered from JavaScript data.

Each product includes:

- Product image
- Product name
- Product description
- Product price
- Add to Cart button

---

## Add Product Form

Users can add new products using a separate form page.

Form accepts:

- Product Name
- Product Price
- Product Description
- Product Image URL

Behavior:

- Validates all required fields
- Creates new product object
- Adds product dynamically
- Stores newly added product
- Product appears instantly in product listing

---

## Add to Cart

Users can add products directly to cart.

Behavior:

- If product does not exist → Added as new item
- If product already exists → Quantity increases

---

## Shopping Cart

Users can:

### Increase Quantity

Increase product quantity using **+** button.

---

### Decrease Quantity

Decrease quantity using **−** button.

If quantity reaches 0, the product is automatically removed.

---

### Remove Product

Remove item completely from cart using Remove button.

---

## Dynamic Cart Count

Header displays total number of products currently added.

Example:

```text

- Quantity changes
- Product is removed

---

## Toast Notifications

Interactive toast messages appear for:
